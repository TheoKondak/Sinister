# SINISTER

## WARNING:

## !! This project is not tested enough for production unless you know what you are doing and you do your own debugging !!

## An SCSS and JS utility library.

This project intends to act as a last-layer CSS override for CMS systems or for an SCSS organization platform for any other project. It also intends to host some JS components, that will add functionality to a website, and perform various tasks for more see `@get-sinister/js` (under construction).

This is a one-man project. I only work on the project only when I have some free time, and I do some basic testing, but be aware that some things might not work as intended.

See [sinister sass documentation](https://github.com/TheoKondak/Sinister/blob/main/scss/README.md)
