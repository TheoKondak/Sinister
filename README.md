# SINISTER

# WARNING:

# !! This project is not tested enough for production unless you know what you are doing and you do your own debugging !!

## An SCSS and JS utility library.

This project intends to act as a last-layer CSS override for CMS systems or for an SCSS organization platform for any other project. It also intends to host some JS components, that will add functionality to a website, and perform various tasks for more see `@get-sinister/js` (under construction).

This is a one-man project. I only work on the project only when I have some free time, and I do some basic testing, but be aware that some things might not work as intended.


## How to install

The project is split into an scss component, and a js component. Visit npm pages for more info on how to install, or read the README.md files inside the respective folders.
