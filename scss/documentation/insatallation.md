# Sinister Installation

<br>

To install sinister, [download node](https://nodejs.dev/download/).

Then open a terminal inside the project and type:

```
npm install @get-sinister/sass
```

After installation, a script will run and will create an scss folder inside the root of your project.

Inside scss folder, you can start working with your project.

In case you want to move the project to some other folder location, you will have to update the package location manually (for now).

To do that find `_sin.scss` and update the path accordingly.
